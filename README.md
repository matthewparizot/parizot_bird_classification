# parizot_bird_classification
Small-scale classification model based on a Kaggle dataset.

Used MaxPooling and Convolution layers to create a Tensorflow model capable of recognizing bird species from a random subset of the larger dataset. Final model produced over 90% accuracy on test data and approximately 90% when used on validation data set.
